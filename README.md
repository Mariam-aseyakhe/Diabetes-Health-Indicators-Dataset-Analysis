# üìÅDiabetes Health Indicators Dataset Analysis

# Project Background 
Diabetes is one of the most widespread and challenging chronic diseases globally, affecting hundreds of millions of people. Identification of risk factors plays a crucial role in prevention of diabetes.
In this project, I analyze the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset to uncover patterns and risk factors associated with diabetes. Using SQL for data exploration and Power BI for data visualization, the project aims to provide a clear and data driven understanding of how demographic, behavioral, and health conditions contribute to diabetes risk. The insights generated contribute to healthcare strategies and can support future research in chronic disease prevention.
# Data Structure and Overview
In this analysis i used the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset from Kaggle, which contains 253,680 survey responses to the CDC‚Äôs Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS2015).

Key variables include:

Diabetes_012: No diabetes, Prediabetes, Diabetes
HighBP: High blood pressure (0/1)
HighCol: High cholesterol (0/1)
BMI: Body Mass Index
Stroke: Ever had a stroke
Smoker: Ever smoked 100 cigarettes (0/1)
PhysActivity: Physical activity in past 30 days
Fruits: Consume Fruit 1 or more times per day
Veggies: Consume Vegetables 1 or more times per day
Age: Coded from 1 (18‚Äì24) to 13 (80+)
Income: 1‚Äì8 1 = less than $10,000 5 = less than $35,000 8 = $75,000 or more
Education: Education level scale from 1‚Äì6

Power BI visualisations are structured on three categories:

o Demographics & Socioeconomic factors: age, gender, education level, and income group.

o Health status & conditions: BMI, high blood pressure, high cholesterol check, menthally unhealthy days and stroke.

o Lifestyle & behaviors: Fruits and veggies intake, smoking, physical activity and doctor cost barriers.

# Executive Summary
This analysis shows that diabetes is more than a blood sugar level it is a condition deeply rooted in a combination of demographic, behavioural and health conditions risk factors. The project reveals how age, body mass index, lipid and blood pressure levels, physical activity, smoking habits, and socio-economic context each play a role in diabetes risk.
